              <p>
                This app was created as the final project for the CS50x Harvard
                course. This tool was designed to create an interactive cash
                flow system that allows users to import transactions from a CSV
                file. Instead of manually managing incomes and expenses in
                Excel, save the data as a CSV file and upload it here. The tool
                will then generate a daily balance, summarize all expenses and
                incomes, and organize the transactions by date.

              <p>
                This application was created as the final project for Le Wagon
                Bootcamp. In a group of four, we had about three weeks to make
                it. The project's standout feature was the seamless ability to
                record an expense by uploading a receipt.

                This project was made as part of Le Wagon Bootcamp. The
                application has the following features: user authentication,
                add, edit, and delete castles, and a map to show the castles'
                locations. It is also possible to create a reservation from the
                guest site and manage the reservations from the host site.
